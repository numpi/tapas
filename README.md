This MATLAB toolbox implements the approach described in "Stochastic modeling and 
evaluation of large interdependent composed models through Kronecker 
algebra and Exponential sums", by G. Masetti, L. Robol, S. Chiaradonna,
F. Di Giandomenico, submitted."

In order to run the experiments one needs to install the 
[TT-Toolbox](https://github.com/oseledets/TT-Toolbox). Assuming TT-Toolbox 
is copied in this directory, one can launch the experiments running

```
>> cd TT-Toolbox; setup; cd ..
>> addpath examples/
>> test_examples;
```
